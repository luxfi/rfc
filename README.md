# LUX Request for Comments (RFC)
Proposals to improve any of the LUX Reference Implementations (LRIs).  
See the details on all of the LRIs [here](https://github.com/roaidev/docs/blob/9f558077e59a6ee52ee693c6f25a77fe1729977b/network/FOR%20CONTRIBUTORS/LUX%20Reference%20Implementations%20(LRI).md)


## Meta MRCs about MRCs
- For most RFCs in general [RFC00](https://github.com/luxfi/rfc/blob/main/RFC00.md) is the first Meta RFC about how to submit an RFC.â€¨
- For RFCs about adding new assets, yield sources, chains, see this [RFC guide.](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IMPLEMENTED/MRC15.md)
- Similar to the function of the [ERC system](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc ) serves in Ethereum, the RFC process provides a common language to describe interactions between models, agents, compute, payments, funding and so forth.
- There is a dedicated forum on Github Discussions for LUX RFCs [here](https://github.com/orgs/luxfi/discussions).
