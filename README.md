# Morpheus Request for Comments (MRC)
Proposals to improve any of the Morpheus Reference Implementations (MRIs).

## Meta MRCs about MRCs
- For most MRCs in general [MRC00](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC00.md) is the first Meta MRC about how to submit an MRC.â€¨
- For MRCs about adding new assets, yield sources, chains, see this [MRC guide.](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IMPLEMENTED/MRC15.md)
- Similar to the function of the [ERC system](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc ) serves in Ethereum, the MRC process provides a common language to describe interactions between models, agents, compute, payments, funding and so forth.
- There is a dedicated forum on Discord for the discussion of MRCs [here](https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1218593251079094383).
